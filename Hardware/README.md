## Hardware

KiCad project and exported Gerber files to use directly to order boards.

* Two-layer board, 142x142 mm, nothing special or unusual regarding vias, traces, pads, drilling or otherwise.
* Gerber/drill files have been used with JLCPCB to order PCB:s that are exactly as expected (their default options for a two-layer board, only thing requested was black solder-mask.
* The Gerber/drill files currently uploaded correspond to revision A of the board. There are a couple of minor changes that will be made in revision B that should make it into any files used to make PCB:s. It is nothing fatal but especially the toggle switch footprints need to be changed.
* The KiCad project also is at revision A. See above comment.
