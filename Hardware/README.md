## Hardware

KiCad project and exported Gerber files to use directly to order boards.

* Gerber/drill files have been used with JLCPCB without issue
* The Gerber/drill files currently uploaded correspond to revA of the board. There are a couple of minor changes that will be made in revision B that should make into new files for producing PCB:s. It is nothing fatal but especially the toggle switch footprints need to be changed.
* The KiCad project also is at revision A. See above comment.
