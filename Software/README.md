## Software

Arduino IDE project with full functionality as well as binaries ready to flash the Raspberry Pi Pico with.<br>
A somewhat more general project that does not require Aruino IDE to build might be available further on.
<br>
A first version making it possible to use everything on the board except the A/B encoder signals is available now with <br>
the Pi Pico appearing as a USB Gamepad to any general high-level operating system. Testing this in DCS has been done and is working<br>
as expected. As soon as it has been cleaned up a little bit it will be posted here!
