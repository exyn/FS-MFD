## Mechanics

Project including the files needed to generate compatible files for 3D-printing of the enclosure as well as
already exported files to be used directly to print it.

# First look
The enclosure is starting to take form.<br>
We also have thoughts about making it easy to mount the MFD to aluminium rails to integrate them into a larger simulator design. All files will be available here for printing and modifications.<br><br>
