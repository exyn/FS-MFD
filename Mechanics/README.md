## Mechanics

Project including the files needed to generate compatible files for 3D-printing of the enclosure as well as
already exported files to be used directly to print it.

# First look
Something like this will be used to print the main part covering the board itself. The next part will be placed along the surface you want to place the MFD on and we will have a stand connecting the top of the MFD with the part along the surface to make it more sturdy. The general deisgn will be a bit like the Cougar MFD:s but again with a stand to avoid the main part folding back as buttons are pressed.<br>
We also have thoughts about making it easy to mount the MFD to aluminium rails to integrate them into a larger simulator design. All files will be available here for printing and modifications.<br><br>
