## FS-MFD
Simple USB Flight-Simulator MFD designed with KiCad for use with DCS/MSFS. Cheaper than commercial alternatives and every possibility to customise.<br>
Easy-to-get components, and everything through-hole, to make it easy to solder for anyone.<br>
One board with all components and the PCB ordered and delivered from JLCPCB was about $21 for our first run.<br>
Accompanying 3D-printable enclosure.<br>

#### Features:

* 20 x Tactile Switches (Buttons)
* 2 x Rotary Encoder (with push-button)
* 2 x Toggle Switch/Slide Switch
* Raspberry Pi Pico control board/USB interface
* Simple SW project for use as a general Gamepad USB device available as source and binary.

For any questions send an e-mail to gustaf.lindstroem@gmail.com. There will be more projects to come.<br>
There might be a future version of this board with display (as an option maybe). It's designed with VR use in mind first though.<br>
Also if anyone has any specific request there is no problem for me to design and route a pcb as long as it will be licensed open source.<br>
Should anyone use our material please give a simple credit by linking. Everything is open to use, modify etc. of course though.
